## Context

### Instructions

<p class = "text"> The brief for this project was to carry out a survey of cycle traffic in Montpellier, through the analysis of datasets such as Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole's VéloMagg bike runs, cyclist and pedestrian counts and data from the open road map. </p>

<p class = "text"> This project had to combine aspects of interactive visualisation and the creation of a website. We had a choice of temporal resolution and the data was available from 2020 to 2024. </p>

### Problematic

<p class = "text"> We decided that our project would focus on the following question: ‘What is the impact of the Tour de France 2023 on the behaviour of cyclists in Montpellier before, during and after the event?’. </p> 

### Aim

<p class = "text"> The goal is to analyze whether this sporting event, which took place in July 2023, has had an impact on the habits of cyclists in the city of Montpellier. </p>

### Hypothesis

<p class = "text"> 
Based in part on the work of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337445763_L'impact_social_des_grands_evenements_sportifs_reflexions_theoriques_et_methodologiques_a_partir_de_l'Euro_2016">Charrier et al., 2019</a> and our personal reflections, we believe that a high-profile event such as the Tour de France can encourage people to cycle, during or after the Tour de France period. We have therefore made the assumption that the number of cyclists will increase during the period of the Tour de France and the following weeks. </p>

## Analyses

<p class = "text"> We decided to structure our analyses in order to compare several time periods, but always focusing on the dates of the Tour de France. That is, we compared the cycling traffic: </p>

<ul class = "text">
  <li> Statistics: between periods of 3 months (before, during and after the Tour de France), and between weeks (<a href="analyses/statistics.html#graph1">see graph</a>). </li>
  <li> Interactive map: between the different days of the week. </li>
  <li> Video: between different times of the day. </li>
</ul>

## Data

<p class = "text"> To carry out this study, we selected several types of data. </p>

<p class = "text"> Firstly, we retrieved data on the journeys made by VéloMagg bikes between stations in the VéloMagg network in the Montpellier metropolitan area. </p>

<p class = "text"> Secondly, we have retrieved data for each of the bicycle counters (eco-counters) in production in the Montpellier Metropolitan Area, showing the number of bicycles (and pietons in some cases) counted. The daily data is the total of the previous day's count. This information is divided into as many files as there are eco-counters. Each eco-counter is identified by a serial number, which we were able to find and associate with its latitude and longitude. </p>

<p class = "text"> All the data we have selected was extracted between April 2023 and October 2023. This corresponds to 3 months before the Tour de France and 3 months after, which we thought was a good margin for observing changes and  which is just over half a year (7 months). </p>

<p class = "text"> We have processed and re-organised this data so that it can be used in various scripts (fully available on our Github page) to produce graphs, maps and a video. </p>

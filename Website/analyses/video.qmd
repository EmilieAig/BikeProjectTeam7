<p class = "text"> This allows us to deepen the results we have obtained in the maps game and will allow us to look at what is happening in terms of traffic of cyclists during the different hours of a day. </p>

<p class = "text"> We decided to choose a day of the week because we could notice on the maps that there was less traffic during the weekend.</p>

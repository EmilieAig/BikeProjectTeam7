    "text": "Context\n\nInstructions\n\nThe brief for this project was to carry out a survey of cycle traffic in Montpellier, through the analysis of datasets such as Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole’s VéloMagg bike runs, cyclist and pedestrian counts and data from the open road map.\n\n\nThis project had to combine aspects of interactive visualisation and the creation of a website. We had a choice of temporal resolution and the data was available from 2020 to 2024.\n\n\n\nProblematic\n\nWe decided that our project would focus on the following question: ‘What is the impact of the Tour de France 2023 on the behaviour of cyclists in Montpellier before, during and after the event?’.\n\n\n\nAim\n\nThe goal is to analyze whether this sporting event, which took place in July 2023, has had an impact on the habits of cyclists in the city of Montpellier.\n\n\n\nHypothesis\n\nBased in part on the work of Charrier et al., 2019 and our personal reflections, we believe that a high-profile event such as the Tour de France can encourage people to cycle, during or after the Tour de France period. We have therefore made the assumption that the number of cyclists will increase during the period of the Tour de France and the following weeks."

    "text": "Data\n\nTo carry out this study, we selected several types of data.\n\n\nFirstly, we retrieved data on the journeys made by VéloMagg bikes between stations in the VéloMagg network in the Montpellier metropolitan area.\n\n\nSecondly, we have retrieved data for each of the bicycle counters (eco-counters) in production in the Montpellier Metropolitan Area, showing the number of bicycles (and pietons in some cases) counted. The daily data is the total of the previous day’s count. This information is divided into as many files as there are eco-counters. Each eco-counter is identified by a serial number, which we were able to find and associate with its latitude and longitude.\n\n\nAll the data we have selected was extracted between April 2023 and October 2023. This corresponds to 3 months before the Tour de France and 3 months after, which we thought was a good margin for observing changes and which is just over half a year (7 months).\n\n\nWe have processed and re-organised this data so that it can be used in various scripts (fully available on our Github page) to produce graphs, maps and a video."

The statistical analyses focused on the following periods :\n\n\n\nBefore the Tour de France : April to June.\n\n\nDuring the Tour de France : July 1st to July 23rd.\n\n\nAfter the Tour de France : late July to October.\n\n\n\nWe carried out a number of statistical analyses to see if our hypothesis could be validated. These analyses are not intended to be taken literally, as there are many other parameters to be taken into account, but they are a short preliminary study of our data.\n\n\nWe began by performing descriptive analyses to give us a visual representation of our data. We then carried out tests to check the normality and homogeneity of the variances in order to choose the appropriate statistical test. Finally, we performed the test and compared the results with our hypothesis."

    "text": "Results\n\nWe started by conducting descriptive analyses to get a first idea of our data. We found an average of 610.06 passes in front of eco-counters during the period before the Tour de France 523.07 passes during the Tour de France and 599.80 passes after the Tour de France. We see that there seems to be a slight decrease during the Tour de France, which would be the opposite of our hypothesis, but we will see if this difference is significant.\n\n\nFollowing our descriptive analyses, we obtained the following graph:\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the total number of bicycles passing in front of the city of Montpellier’s eco-counters per week. Please note that this data does not correspond to the number of bicycles, as a bicycle may be counted several times if it passes in front of several counters. This data therefore corresponds to the total number of times cyclists pass in front of a counter in Montpellier. We can see that the Tour de France period is highlighted in green.\n\n\nVisually, we can see that there does not seem to be an increase during the period of the Tour de France compared with the periods before and after. We also note that there is a sharp decrease in the number of crossings in front of a meter during the period of August and that it goes back to early September.\n\n\nWe continued by checking the homogeneity of variances and normality. Then, given that normality was not verified, we performed a Kruskal Wallis test (because we had several independent groups and only one variable of interest). We obtained the following graph to represent the differences between our groups.\n\n\n\nThis graph is a boxplot that represents the number of passes in front of eco-counters according to our three periods of interest.\n\n\n\nThe box shows the interquartile range, which contains the middle 50% of the data (from the 25th to the 75th percentile).\n\n\nThe horizontal line inside the box représents the median (the middle value of the dataset).\n\n\nThe whiskerw extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range.\n\n\n\nOur analyses by the test of Kruskal Wallis showed us that there did not seem to be a significant difference between our different periods in terms of the number of passages in front of eco-counters of the vulle de Montpellier. Indeed, we found a p-value of 0.16 and an H-value of 3.59. Thus, the differences do not seem to be significant."

However, if we look at the first graph we got, we can say that this evolution could be linked to other factors such as school and work holiday periods. Indeed, we note that there is a decrease at the beginning of the summer holiday period (July) and that seems to be accentuated during the August period. In addition, at the beginning of September, during the school year, there seems to be a strong increase in the number of bicycle trips.\n\n\nThus, it would be interesting to do more detailed analyses than those we have done, but also to look at the link with school holidays."

This model is well suited to data with temporal variations, making it an ideal choice for modelling cycle traffic. The prediction was influenced by factors such as days of the week, weather and local events (such as the Tour de France).\n\n\nThe predictions generated by Prophet have been integrated into the interactive map, making it possible to visualise predicted traffic levels on the various routes between stations.\n\n\nTo make this prediction, we decided to calculate only the shortest paths between each of the stations and not all the possible paths, for the sake of optimising journey times and also to make the map easier to read.\n\n\n\nGraphs\n\nIn this maps, several days can be selected at the same time, but we advise you to select the days one after the other for consistent predictions.\n\n\nMap of the cycling traffic forecast in Montpellier during the second week of the Tour de France:\n\n\n\n\nMap of the cycling traffic in Montpellier during the second week of the Tour de France:\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle stations (Eco-counters)\n\nThe stations are represented by blue markers distributed around the city.\n\n\n\nPaths between stations\n\nThe lines connecting the stations correspond to the paths between them. The colours of the lines vary according to the number of cycles predicted to pass along the route:\n\n\n\nDark red: Very high intensity (&gt; 1500).\n\n\nLight red: High intensity (1201-1500).\n\n\nOrange: Moderate intensity (901-1200).\n\n\nYellow: Moderate intensity (601-900).\n\n\nLight green: Low intensity (301-600).\n\n\nDark green: Very low intensity (≤ 300).\n\n\n\n\nGeographical coverage\n\nPredictions cover a 15km radius around Montpellier, including areas such as Saint-Jean-de-Védas, Castelnau-le-Lez, and Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone. We decided not to extend this area because bike journeys were becoming rare and we weren’t sure whether a station further away would actually correspond to a journey between that station and Montpellier or just a journey within its city."

Both seem to show that there are far fewer cyclists during the 15-16 July period. This corresponds to the weekend and could therefore justify a drop in the number of cyclists compared with the week.\n\n\n\nBetween maps\n\nIf we want to check whether our predictions seem to match reality, we can compare our two maps. If we look in more detail, we can see that our predictions seem to reflect reality depending on the day (fewer people at weekends in both cases). However, our predictions seem to have underestimated the number of cyclists who pass in front of the Montpellier eco-counters because, if we look at the intensities of the passages, even vaguely we can see that there are many more colours in shades of red in the map representing the actual data than in our prediction map."

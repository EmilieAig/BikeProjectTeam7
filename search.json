We believe that an event such as the Tour de France can encourage people to get on their bikes, whether just before, during or just after the event. In addition, we believe that these effects are not felt over a long period before and after the event, and that they dissipate quickly."

    "text": "Data\n\nTo carry out this study, we selected several types of data.\n\n\nFirstly, we retrieved data on the journeys made by VéloMagg bikes between stations in the VéloMagg network in the Montpellier metropolitan area.\n\n\nSecondly, we have retrieved data for each of the bicycle counters (eco-counters) in production in the Montpellier Metropolitan Area, showing the number of bicycles (and piétions in some cases) counted. The daily data is the total of the previous day’s count. This information is divided into as many files as there are eco-counters. Each eco-counter is identified by a serial number, which we were able to find and associate with its latitude and longitude.\n\n\nAll the data we have selected was extracted between April 2023 and October 2023. This corresponds to 3 months before the Telethon and 3 months after, which we thought was a good margin for observing changes around the Tour de France and which is just over half a year (7 months)."

    "text": "Map predictions\n\nPresentation\n\nThe interactive map below shows predicted bicycle traffic in the city of Montpellier from 10 July to 16 July 2023. These dates represent the intermediate week (2nd week out of 3) of the Tour de France.\n\n\nThe bicycle traffic predictions were made using the ‘Prophet’ model, a flexible tool for time series analysis. This model is particularly well suited to data with temporal variations, making it an ideal choice for modelling cycle traffic. The prediction was influenced by factors such as days of the week, weather and local events (such as the Tour de France). The predictions generated by Prophet have been integrated into the interactive map, making it possible to visualise predicted traffic levels on the various routes between stations. To make this prediction, we decided to calculate only the shortest paths between each of the stations and not all the possible paths, for the sake of optimising journey times and also to make the map easier to read.\n\n\n\nGraph\n\n\n\nOn this graph, the data is represented by coloured lines linking the different bicycle stations.\n\n\n\nCycle stations (Eco-counters)\n\nThe stations are represented by blue markers distributed around the city.\n\n\n\nPaths between stations\n\nThe lines connecting the stations correspond to the predicted paths between them. The colours of the lines vary according to the levels of intensity of cycle traffic, i.e. according to the number of cycles predicted to pass along the route:\n\n\n\nRed: Very high intensity (&gt; 1500).\n\n\nOrange: High intensity (1200-1500).\n\n\nYellow: Moderate intensity (900-1200).\n\n\nLight green: Low intensity (300-900).\n\n\nDark green: Very low intensity (&lt; 300).\n\n\n\n\nGeographical coverage\n\nPredictions cover a 15km radius around Montpellier, including areas such as Saint-Jean-de-Védas, Castelnau-le-Lez, and Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone. We decided not to extend this area because bike journeys were becoming rare and we weren’t sure whether a station further away would actually correspond to a journey between that station and Montpellier or just a journey within its city.\n\n\n\nLegend\n\nThe legend in the bottom left-hand corner explains the meaning of the line colours. The control at the top right allows you to view data for specific days. Several days can be selected at the same time, but we advise you to select the days one after the other for consistent predictions."

    "text": "Results\n\nWe started by conducting descriptive analyses to get a first idea of our data. We found an average of 610.06 passes in front of eco-counters during the period before the Tour de France 523.07 passes during the Tour de France and 599.80 passes after the Tour de France. We see that there seems to be a slight decrease during the Tour de France, which would be the opposite of our hypothesis, but we will see if this difference is significant.\n\n\nFollowing our descriptive analyses, we obtained the following graph:\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the total number of bicycles passing in front of the city of Montpellier’s eco-counters per week. Please note that this data does not correspond to the number of bicycles, as a bicycle may be counted several times if it passes in front of several counters. This data therefore corresponds to the total number of journeys made by cyclists in Montpellier (number of times they pass in front of a counter). We can see that the Tour de France period is highlighted in green.\n\n\nVisually, we can see that there does not seem to be an increase during the period of the Tour de France compared with the periods before and after. We also note that there is a sharp decrease in the number of crossings in front of a meter during the period of August and that it goes back to early September.\n\n\nWe then continued by checking the homogeneity of variances and normality. Then, given that normality was not verified, we performed a Kruskal Wallis test (because we had several independent groups and only one variable of interest). We obtained the following graph to represent the differences between our groups.\n\n\n\nThis graph is a boxplot that represents the number of passes in front of eco-counters according to our three periods of interest.\n\n\n\nThe box shows the interquartile range, which contains the middle 50% of the data (from the 25th to the 75th percentile).\n\n\nThe horizontal line inside the box représents the median (the middle value of the dataset).\n\n\nThe whiskerw extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range.\n\n\n\nOur analyses by the test of Kruskal Wallis showed us that there did not seem to be a significant difference between our different periods in terms of the number of passages in front of eco-counters of the vulle de Montpellier. Indeed, we found a p-value of 0.16 and an H-value of 3.59. Thus, the differences do not seem to be significant."

However, if we look at the first graph we got, we can say that this evolution could be linked to other factors such as school and work holiday periods. Indeed, we note that there is a decrease at the beginning of the summer holiday period (July) and that seems to be accentuated during the August period. In addition, at the beginning of September, during the school year, there seems to be a strong increase in the number of bicycle trips.\n\n\nThus, it would be interesting to do more detailed analyses than those we have done, but also to look at the link with school holidays."

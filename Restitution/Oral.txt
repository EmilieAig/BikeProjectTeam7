While processing the data: 

- We noticed that there were 5 DATA_ecoCompt files that contained no data for the period we wanted to use 
(probably because they had been installed after the fact). We therefore decided to delete these files, which would be of no use to us.

- We have seen that there is missing data inside the files, with 'null'. Where this was the case, we deleted the corresponding lines because 
we couldn't analyze them.

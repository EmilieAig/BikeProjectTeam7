The daily data is the total of the previous day’s count. This information is divided into as many files as there are eco-counters. Each eco-counter is identified by a serial number, which we were able to find and associate with its latitude and longitude.\n\n\nAll the data we have selected was extracted between April 2023 and October 2023. This corresponds to 3 months before the Telethon and 3 months after, which we thought was a good margin for observing changes around the Tour de France and which is just over half a year (7 months)."

We believe that an event such as the Tour de France can encourage people to get on their bikes, whether just before, during or just after the event. In addition, we believe that these effects are not felt over a long period before and after the event, and that they dissipate quickly."

However, if we look at the first graph we got, we can say that this evolution could be linked to other factors such as school and work holiday periods. Indeed, we note that there is a decrease at the beginning of the summer holiday period (July) and that seems to be accentuated during the August period. In addition, at the beginning of September, during the school year, there seems to be a strong increase in the number of bicycle trips.\n\n\nThus, it would be interesting to do more detailed analyses than those we have done, but also to look at the link with school holidays."

We believe that an event such as the Tour de France can encourage people to get on their bikes, whether just before, during or just after the event. In addition, we believe that these effects are not felt over a long period before and after the event, and that they dissipate quickly."

    "text": "Discussion\n\nOur analyses seem to show that there is no significant difference in the number of cycles passing through eco-counters in the city of Montpellier between the periods before, during and after the Tour de France. However, if we look at the first graph we got, we can say that this evolution could be linked to other factors such as school and work holiday periods. Indeed, we note that there is a decrease at the beginning of the summer holiday period (July) and that seems to be accentuated during the August period. In addition, at the beginning of September, during the school year, there seems to be a strong increase in the number of bicycle trips.\n\n\nThus, it would be interesting to do more detailed analyses than those we have done, but also to look at the link with school holidays."

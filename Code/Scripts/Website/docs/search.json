    "text": "Data\nTo conduct this study, we have chosen to analyze data on bicycle usage spanning from April to October 2023. This time frame allows us to examine bike traffic before, during, and after the Tour de France, providing a comprehensive view of usage patterns around this event. The selection of this period is crucial for capturing short-term trends related to the Tour and distinguishing them from seasonal or contextual factors that might also influence cycling behavior."
